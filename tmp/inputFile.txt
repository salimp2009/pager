Read the remaining contents of a Handle as a string. The Handle is closed once the contents have been read, or if an exception is thrown.

Internally, this function reads a chunk at a time from the lower-level buffering abstraction, and concatenates the chunks into a single string once the entire file has been read.

pub const fn is_empty(&self) -> bool
Returns true if self has a length of zero bytes.

Examples
Basic usage:

let s = "";
assert!(s.is_empty());

let s = "not empty";
assert!(!s.is_empty());
